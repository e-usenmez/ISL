## Labs and Exercise Solutions



In working through the Labs and Exercises I added my notes, additional info, and commentary where I ran into errors and how I resolved them.
I highly recommend spending the time to work through Conceptual questions before attempting the Applied exercises. It is extremely important to get the fundamentals and build on them. Afterall, time spent on the basics is time never wasted.
