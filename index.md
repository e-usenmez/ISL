## Labs and Exercise Solutions



In working through the Labs and Exercises I added my notes and some additional info. I also included commentary on where I ran into errors and how I resolved them.

I highly recommend spending some time to work through the Conceptual questions before attempting the Applied exercises. It is extremely important to get the fundamentals right and build on them. Afterall, time spent on the basics is time never wasted.

I would recommend using [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) for R, and JupyterLab within [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). They both have dark mode which makes it a whole lot easier on the eyes.

For Python, I would also recommend looking through the guides of the following libraries: 
<br><br>
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), [Numpy](https://numpy.org), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), and [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org)
