Solutions to the book "Introduction to Statistical Learning" using Python and R.

This repository contains my solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises for the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://statlearning.com/) written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trever Hastie, and Robert Tibshani. 

The book itself uses R. I use both R and Python to solve the exercises. I will update this Repository Chapter by Chapter as I go along. In working through Python, I relied a lot on the approaches used by [Alan Martyn](www.alanmartyn.com).
