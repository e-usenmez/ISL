Unofficial Solutions to "Introduction to Statistical Learning" using Python and R.

This repository contains my solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises for the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://statlearning.com/) written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trever Hastie, and Robert Tibshani. 

The book itself uses R. I use both R and Python to solve the exercises. I will update this Repository Chapter by Chapter as I go along. 

In working through the exercises I relied a lot on the approaches used by the following:

   -> For Python:  
      [stack overflow community](https://stackoverflow.com/); [Alan Martyn](www.alanmartyn.com); [Matt Caudill](https://github.com/mscaudill/IntroStatLearn)

   -> For R:  
      [R Code for ISLR](https://statlearning.com/code.html); [stack overflow community](https://stackoverflow.com/); [Amir Sadoughi](http://asadoughi.github.io/stat-learning); [Anmol Thind](https://github.com/athi94)

For R, I recommend using [Rstudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and, for Python, either JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). 
Also if you are a Mac user, you will need to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) to run the fix() function in R.

If you are new to R I highly recommend the excellent educational modules at [Teacup Giraffes and Statistics] (https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html)

For these exercises I additionally installed the following packages:
   
   -> R: ISLR, car
   
   -> Python: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

For writing the formulas in the Markdowns, I used the help of [Visual Math Editor](http://visualmatheditor.equatheque.net/VisualMathEditor.html)
